MCCURL

A series of scripts that pulls data from the MC API (main) based on an input file, titled INIT. Initreader reads the init file and feeds the arguments to main, which performs the request and parses the request to ouput into, currently, a CSV. Eventually, the program will inject the data into an SQL DB.
